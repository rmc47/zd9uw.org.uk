<p>First licensed in 1996 age 11, I now enjoy a wide variety of radio-related activities, from DX’peditions and other portable operations to RAYNET (voluntary emergency communications) and contesting, both on HF and VHF. When not playing radio, I’m a software developer, and occasionally the two hobbies get mixed up. For something completely different, I also fly power kites and occasionally dabble a little in photography.</p>
