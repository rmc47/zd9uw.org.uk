		<p>
Martin G3ZAY and Rob M0VFC have secured places on the "Baltic Trader" travelling to Tristan da Cunha on Sept 20th from Cape Town. They expect to have about 7 days on the island from about Sept 27th though this could be curtailed by bad weather. They do not expect to have time to cover all bands and probably will not be able to operate on 1.8 or 50MHz. The callsign will be ZD9UW to be used by both operators. Logs will be uploaded to LoTW and ClubLog immediately after the operation (or during if an Internet connection is available) and cards will be handled by OQRS on Clublog, direct to G3ZAY(?), or email bureau requests. Please try to avoid sending inbound cards via the bureau.

<p>
We would like to try to raise some extra funds for the <a href="http://www.tristandc.com/asstrustfund.php">Tristan da Cunha Educational Trust Fund</a>. We plan to take some QSL cards to the island and anyone willing to donate $25 via <a href="trustfund.html">our website</a> (up to a max of 100 donors) will receive a direct card mailed from Tristan Da Cunha for the first two QSOs they make (further cards will be sent at no extra charge when we return home). Please note that mail from the island may take several months to arrive!
