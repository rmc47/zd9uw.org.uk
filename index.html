<h3>Welcome to ZD9UW</h3>
<p>
	On 17th September 2012, Martin G3ZAY and Rob M0VFC will leave England and start our journey for Tristan da Cunha - the most remote inhabited island in the world. The first leg takes us to Cape Town, where we board the MV "Baltic Trader" and embark on a seven day journey over the South Atlantic Ocean. Weather permitting, we should arrive on Tristan around the 27th September, where we will operate from until the 4th October before returning to Cape Town.
<p>
<p>
	It promises to be the adventure of a lifetime!
