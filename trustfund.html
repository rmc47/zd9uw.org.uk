			We would like to try to raise some extra funds for the <a href="http://www.tristandc.com/asstrustfund.php">Tristan da Cunha Educational Trust Fund</a>. We plan to take some QSL cards to the island and anyone willing to donate $25 will receive a direct card mailed from Tristan Da Cunha for the first two QSOs they make (further cards will be sent at no extra charge when we return home). Please note that mail from the island may take several months to arrive!
		</p>
		<p>
			In the (hopefully unlikely) event that you don't manage to work us, we'll still send you a card, but it will be marked as "SAMPLE" instead of your QSO details.
