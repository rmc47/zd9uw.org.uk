<ul>
	<li>OQRS Direct requests: all received up to 3rd November 2300Z posted on or before 3rd November</li>
	<li>Direct cards received by post: all received up to 3rd November 2300Z posted on or before 3rd November</li>
	<li>OQRS Buro requests: not processed yet</li>
</ul>

<p>By way of some statistics, I've confirmed 706 QSOs with 511 different callsigns. This corresponds to around 16.5% of QSOs in the log so far.</p>
<p>Here's some of today's outgoing mail:</p>
