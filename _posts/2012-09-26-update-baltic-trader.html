<p>We've been informed that the Baltic Trader (the cargo ship that Rob is on) has been slightly delayed. They are now expecting to reach ZD9 on Saturday 29th September.</p>
<p>Luckily, the weather on Saturday afternoon is looking good, and so Rob should be able to land quickly. Please note, however, that if the weather changes, it may take some time for him to get ashore.</p>
