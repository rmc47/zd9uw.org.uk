<p>Rob M0VFC arrived on Tristan da Cunha earlier today (30th September) and managed to get on air as ZD9UW on 15m just before 1800 UTC this evening. He's currently only using 100W due to a minor issue with the amplifier, but he hopes to resolve this very soon.</p>
<p>Just a reminder: Rob has very limited internet access in ZD9. This website and the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/zd9uw">@ZD9UW</a> Twitter feed are being updated by Dom M0BLF, who will be in regular contact with Rob during his stay. If you have any messages for Rob, you can email the address shown on QRZ.com. Emails will come to Dom, who will relay them to Rob when possible. Please do not ask questions in Cluster spots, because Rob will not see them while operating.</p>
