<p>After an uneventful flight, we've made it down to Cape Town - complete with all our baggage!.</p>
<p>So far the Baltic Trader is scheduled to depart on time, but we'll know more tomorrow. The crossing is predicted to take 7-8 days, which would get us to Tristan around the 27th or 28th September, but if the weather there is poor, we may not be able too get ashore immediately.</p>
