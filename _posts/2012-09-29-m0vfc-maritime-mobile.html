<p>Rob has been active from the Baltic Trader, the cargo ship taking him to Tristan da Cunha, as M0VFC/MM for the last few days. He installed a vertical 10m dipole at the stern of the Baltic Trader behind the bridge and set up his K3 on the upper bunk in his cabin. Signals were anything between 42 and 59 in the UK. His operating periods were fairly short as he had to remain standing and brace himself against the motion of the ship. </p>
<p>We're pleased to report that he's happy and has made good friends with the ship's crew. Unfortunately, the weather has delayed them a little, and so they are now expecting to reach Tristan tomorrow morning (Sunday 30th September).</p>
