<p>Thanks to so many of you for your kind donations when requesting QSL cards! Any excess from these after QSL expenses will be donated to the Cambridge University Wireless Society, G6UW, who did so much to help me get into this part of the hobby.</p>
<p>I have just collected the QSL cards from the printer's, so will start sending out direct cards today. It may take me a short while to get through all the requests, but you should expect to receive your card in the next week or two if you have already requested it.</p>
<p>I've not yet received the LoTW certificate for ZD9UW, but as soon as I do, all QSOs will be uploaded to LoTW as well.</p>
