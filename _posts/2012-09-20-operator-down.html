<p>Some bad news unfortunately: Martin G3ZAY has been forced to cancel his onward journey from Cape Town to Tristan.</p>
<p>Rob M0VFC will still continue, and be active as ZD9UW. This means that it's now a single operator activation, and will concentrate primarily on SSB with some RTTY. Since our goal is to enable as many people as possible to work ZD9 for the first time, this means the number of bands we can activate will be limited - concentrating mostly on the higher bands.</p>
<p>We're sorry if this means you don't get to work us on the particular slots you were after - we'll do our best given the situation!</p>
