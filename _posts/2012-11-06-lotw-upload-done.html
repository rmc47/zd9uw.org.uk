<p>The ZD9UW log has now been uploaded to LoTW.</p>
<p>LoTW currently reports a processing delay of approximately 42 hours, so the first QSLs can be expected on Sunday (11th November) late afternoon to evening.</p>
<p>If you are in the log but don't get an LoTW confirmation in due course, email me (address on QRZ.com) with your QSO details and I'll check they match my log.</p>
