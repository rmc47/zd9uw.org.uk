<p>Now that Robert is on Tristan da Cunha, he has sent the following message about the 10-day journey to the island:</p>
<p>'Generally, the crossing was very pleasant, if slow. There was a wonderful group of passengers with an amazing wealth of experience - one guy, when asked how many countries he'd visited, simply replied "all of them" - and he's not joking! A couple of the days were rather rough, but it was really just a greater or lesser degree of roll. After the first day or two we mostly stopped bouncing off the walls, but it definitely needed thought whenever you put something down that may roll around.'</p>
