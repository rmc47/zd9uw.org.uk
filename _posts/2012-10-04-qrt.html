<p>As of 1230Z, ZD9UW is now QRT, with just under 4300 QSOs in the log from less than four days on the air.</p>
<p>I'll write a better summary in due course, but right now I've got to get everything packed away before we leave the island in a couple of hours. A huge thank you to everyone who helped make this trip what it is, either back home or the (very many!) of you who called me over the last few days. A couple of photos to end with, one of the operating position (a repurposed chest of drawers and bedside table) and one of the view from my front door...</p>

<p>73 for now, and look forward to working you soon as M0VFC again (maybe /MM first...)</p>
