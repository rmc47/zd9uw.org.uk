<p>I've just been told that the Baltic Trader may depart tomorrow (4th October) at around 1200Z - earlier than the scheduled date of the 5th. I'll keep operating as long as possible, but it looks like tomorrow morning will be the latest unless this changes.</p>
<p>As a result, I'm going to concentrate purely on HF SSB - I know there were several of you looking for ZD9 both on 6m and RTTY, and I'd love to have activated both, but with this very limited amount of time, I need to concentrate on getting as many people in the log at least once as possible, so I'm very sorry to have to cancel these two. Another couple of days and it would have been possible!</p>
<p>Please note that tomorrow morning I will be concentrating on JA / VK / ZL on 20m from around 0600-0800Z.</p>
