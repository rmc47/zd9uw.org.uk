<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
	We will be on Tristan for approximately one week only, so our main goal is to allow as many people as possible to get ZD9 in their log at least once, rather than concentrating on those aiming to work us on multiple slots. Please remember this before asking for specfic bands or modes.
</p>
<h3>Bands & antennas</h3>
<p>We expect to operate on all bands from 80m to 10m. Our antennas will primarily be 1/4wave verticals using fibreglass poles. We'll use an 18m Spiderbeam pole for 80m, 12m on 40m, and 10m poles on the higher bands.</p>
<p>There's unlikely to be time for 160m operation, as we can probably give more people the chance to work us on the higher bands. We will have a small 6m antenna with us, and will be operational on 6m if the band is reasonably open. We may run a beacon if we're able to.</p>
<h3>Modes</h3>
<p>Martin will concentrate on CW, and Rob on SSB. Rob will also be active on RTTY if time and pile-ups permit.</p>
<p>Note that RTTY isn't either of our strong points, so be patient with us!</p>
<p>When one of the radios isn't manned, we'll try and run WSPR, so look out for ZD9UW on <a href="http://wsprnet.org/drupal/wsprnet/spots" target="_new">WSPRnet</a>.</p>
<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>You can use <a href="http://www.clublog.org">Club Log's</a> excellent propagation tools to find the best times and bands to work us on. <a href="https://secure.clublog.org/charts/?c=ZD9UW#r">Go to our expedition page</a>, then click "Geo Propagation" to see preditions between your location and Tristan.</p>
<h3>Internet & DX Cluster access</h3>
<p>We will not have Internet or DX Cluster access while operating. Please avoid asking questions in cluster spots - we won't see them.</p>
