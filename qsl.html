<h3>Direct QSLs</h3>

<h3>Bureau requests</h3>
<p>
	Please use the ClubLog OQRS to request your card. There is no charge for bureau cards. Alternatively, please email M0VFC (address listed on QRZ.com). <b>Please do not send cards via the bureau system - we don't need your card, and it only puts undue load on the system. There is no ZD9 QSL bureau!</b>.
